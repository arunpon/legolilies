# Lego Robotics Club - Team Lego Lilies

## Welcome to the Lego Robotics Club!
This repository is the digital workshop for a dynamic group of young robotics enthusiasts. Here, we explore the fundamentals of engineering, programming, and problem-solving through the exciting world of Lego robotics. Our projects range from simple mechanical structures to more complex robotic builds that integrate sensors and motors using Lego Mindstorms and other Lego robotics kits.

### Key Features:
- **Step-by-Step Guides:** Detailed build instructions and programming guides to help new members start quickly.
- **Code Examples:** Sample programs for controlling the robots using various platforms, including EV3 and SPIKE Prime.
- **Collaborative Projects:** Opportunities for members to contribute to ongoing projects or start their own with the help of the community.
- **Learning Resources:** Links to useful resources for learning more about robotics and enhancing skills.

### Goals:
- **Educate:** Teach kids the basics of mechanical engineering, coding, and robotics in an engaging way.
- **Inspire:** Encourage creativity and innovation by providing a platform for experimenting and sharing new ideas.
- **Build Community:** Connect young robotics enthusiasts to collaborate, share their projects, and grow together.

Join us in this fun and educational journey to build not just robots but also critical thinking and teamwork skills. Whether you're here to learn, teach, or simply share your passion for Lego robotics, there's a place for you in the Lego Robotics Club!
